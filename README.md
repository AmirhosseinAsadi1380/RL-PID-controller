The project consists of three parts:
 - RL_controller.m: It defines the environment, agent, and train properties for the learning process. Also, this code is coupled with the Simulink file as well.
 - localResetFcn.m: To reset the initial conditions for the learning process.
 - RL_controller.slx: The Simulink file contains the dynamic model of the flexible manipulator as the plant, the PID controller, and the agent.
